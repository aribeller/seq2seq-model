This is a simple sequence to sequence model for machine translation. The data sets are somewhat small and so, it isn't
highly performant. However the experience was still useful in
understanding the architecture of sequence to sequence models.

To account for it's limited training data, I only translate
sentences of length 13 or less.

Run the program by calling the bash script followed by the arguments in the following order:
french train
english train
french test
english test
